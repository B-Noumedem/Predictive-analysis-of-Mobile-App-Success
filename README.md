# Predictive-analysis-of-Mobile-App-Success
Nowadays, mobile applications are part of our daily lives. They now account for more than half (52%) of the time spent on digital media on the one hand, and would account for 89% of the time spent by users of on their smartphone.

The aim of this project is to develop a decision-making tool, particularly for developers, to better understand market expectations and predict whether a certain type of application will potentially be more successful than another.


Bearing this in mind, one can wonder whether it is possible to **predict the success of an application on the app store based on the informations availables about this application**.
